## Laptop Batteries

### Battery Replaceability

With some laptops the batteries are very modular and can be replaced very easily. Some laptops have the battery built into it with it never intended to be taken out.

**Replacement Time Spectrum:**

- **Modular batteries:** Five minutes (external release mechanism)
- **Integrated batteries:** One hour+ (requires teardown)

### Battery Technology

**Common Types:**

- **Lithium-Ion (Li-ion)** - Standard laptop battery technology
- **Lithium-Ion Polymer (LiPo)** - Flexible form factor option

**Key Advantage:** No "memory effect" that we had with older batteries. That means charging the battery does not diminish the capacity of the battery.

### Battery Compatibility

Different form factors for each laptop:

- Battery types and styles can vary
- Battery technology is constantly changing
- **Be very specific about knowing what battery the laptop you're working with takes**

### Replacement Procedure

**Modular Batteries:**

- Usually there is a button that releases the battery
- Should be very easy to remove/replace batteries within laptops

**Non-Modular Batteries:**

- If that modularity isn't available for your laptop, you would need a technician to remove your battery
- Requires partial or complete laptop disassembly

## Laptop Keyboard

### Usage and Replaceability

The most used component of the laptop. The keyboard may be swapped out more than any component on the device.

**Easy Replacement Process:**

- Can be easy to replace
- A few screws and a ribbon cable
- It often pops out as a single unit
- **May not always be simple** (depends on manufacturer design)

### Troubleshooting Options

**External Keyboard Workaround:**

- Or connect an external USB keyboard
- Not very portable, but works in a pinch
- Troubleshoot computer to see if it is a hardware or operating system issue
- Might allow you to work around programs to see if it is a problem with the operating system

### Key Cap Repairs

Some repairs might require the removal or replacement of a key cap.

- This can be a delicate procedure
- You have to take special care to not damage the keys or anything underneath the keycap
- There are different components used across different laptops
- **Follow manufacturer procedures/instructions to repair keys correctly**

> **Warning:** Key cap mechanisms vary significantly between manufacturers. Improper removal can cause permanent damage.

## Laptop Memory

### Form Factor Differences

Because laptops have a small form factor the internal components also have a smaller form factor. Including the memory which is smaller than what you would find on a desktop computer.

**SO-DIMM (Small Outline Dual In-Line Memory Module):**

- That is often the memory used in laptops and mobile devices
- On laptops that use SO-DIMM they are easy to install or replace

### Non-Upgradeable Memory

Alternatively, some laptops the memory is soldered to the system board:

- **No upgrade available**
- Requires full system board replacement

### Installation Process

To add or replace memory in one of these systems:

- There's usually a place where you can open up a window on the back of the laptop
- Remove any memory that might be there, or add additional memory into the slots available
- Once you push the memory down onto that particular module, the memory is installed

## Laptop Storage

Just as our desktop computers have a place where we can store operating system files and documents, there is the same for our laptops. Many of our older laptops will use a traditional Hard Drive or spinning drive that has platters to store that information.

### Storage Types

#### Magnetic Disk (Traditional HDDs)

- Traditional spinning drive platters
- **2.5 inch form factors** (3.5 inch for desktops)
- Slower, more mechanical wear

#### SSD (Solid-State Drive)

These days we have moved away from magnetic disk and moved to SSD. An SSD is simply memory and does not have a spinning drive.

**Advantages:**

- It is more reliable
- It is silent
- Has fast access time
- Less latency
- On older laptops you can see it in the computer has a 2.5 inch form factor

#### M.2 Interface

Newer laptops tend to have an M.2 interface which provides a much smaller form factor:

- Meaning it has an easier installation that just needs to plugin to the module
- Does not need SATA data or power cables to have access to the data and to power up the memory drive itself
- With older connections with 2.5 inch form factors there were two separate connections one for data and one for power

**Size Comparison:** ![Alt text](images/Memory Drives SSD 2.5 inch vs M.2.png) _Size comparison of an SSD 2.5 inch on the left vs a M.2 half inch on the right_

### Replacing Laptop Storage

**General Process:**

- It is an all internal procedure
- You have to open a cover on the back of the laptop or open the entire laptop back
- It can be very modular
- You take a couple screws out the back of the drive and the drive slides out

**Installation Steps:**

1. **2.5 inch SSD:** Take the back of the laptop off, unscrewing the drive, disconnecting it from the copper interface
2. **M.2 drive:** Follow the same basic process but with smaller form factor
3. **Reverse the process** to add another drive back

### Migrating from HDD to SSD

Some people want a much more faster, reliable storage and is almost like getting a new laptop. It is a more reliable storage for people who have an older laptop and is a very reliable upgrade to a laptop.

**Manual Migration:**

- You can install a new OS on the SSD and then manually transfer all the documents between drives
- Then install any required applications
- **Although, that is very time consuming**

**Imaging/Cloning Software:** To be able to do that easily we should use **Imaging/Cloning software**:

- Many SSD manufacturers provide SSD imaging software
- There are many commercial and open source options
- You can use third party software to copy everything from one drive (one partition) into a new drive or a (new partition)

**Imaging Process:**

1. **Image Creation:** Sometimes it requires you to create an entire image of the system, and you store that image on a separate storage device
2. **Image Restoration:** Install your new drive, and copy everything from that image back to the new drive
3. **Direct Clone:** Install the old drive and the new drive at the same time and use that same imaging software to image from one device to the other in real time

## 802.11 Wireless and Bluetooth

Many laptops today don't even have a wired network connection, to have any connection to the rest of the world laptops use some type of wireless connection like 802.11 Wireless or Bluetooth.

### 802.11 Wireless

For example, you may be using 802.11 for your **local area network (LAN)** connections inside a building:

- There may be a Mini PCI or Mini PCI Express card that provides that 802.11 functionality
- These cards are meant to be modular so you can install and uninstall the modules from the laptop system board
- These cards often also have small connectors on them that plug into the wireless antennas that are already built into the laptop

![Alt text](images/802.11 Cards.png)

### Bluetooth Connectivity

Bluetooth is often used as a short-range network communication:

- You'll often see it referred to as a **PAN (Personal Area Network)**
- It allows you to connect peripherals like a mouse or a keyboard
- Often they are provided with separate interface cards
- Most newer laptops also have this Bluetooth functionality built into the system board itself

### Installing Wireless Cards

Installing these modular cards are similar to installing memory cards:

1. There is often a panel where you can remove on the back of the laptop that reveals where you can install that particular component
2. Once you find it it usually locks down into the interface with connectors that are built into the interface
3. You also connect the gray wireless antenna wires to the small connectors on the 802.11 Wireless module

## Wi-Fi Antenna Placement

Many of these 802.11 interfaces whether they are on the system board or on an external card, will usually have two separate connectors:

- **Main connector**
- **Auxiliary connector**
- There may also be a **third for all Bluetooth connections**

### Antenna Routing

These antenna wires often wrap around the outside of the laptop screen:

- This allows you to get the antenna wires at the highest point while lifting up your screen
- If you've ever replaced a laptop screen, the antenna wires come out the bottom of the screen so you can connect them to the existing antenna connectors on your system board
- If you followed those wires you would see they go behind your keyboard to the system board where they are connecting to the 802.11 and the Bluetooth connectors

> **Technical Note:** Antenna placement at screen level provides optimal signal reception due to elevation when laptop lid is open.

## Biometrics

Biometrics allow you to sign in or unlock your laptop with a fingerprint reader or face recognition:

- This kind of feature requires configuration within the OS
- This type of biometric security has become very safe in the past few years

**Common Types:**

- **Fingerprint readers** - Most common laptop biometric
- **Face recognition** - Camera-based authentication
- **Retina scanners** - Less common, high-security applications

> **Related:** See [[Windows Security Settings]] for biometric configuration and [[Mobile Device Security]] for additional authentication methods.

## Near-Field Communication (NFC)

**Common Applications:**

- Common on mobile phones and smart watches
- Payments used with Apple Pay or on a smart watch
- Data transfers or authentications
- Used for authentication without typing a password

**Technical Specifications:**

- **Short-distance networking** only 4 centimeters or less to work

**Enterprise Use Cases:**

- Hospital workstations
- Warehouses
- Manufacturing

> **Related:** See [[Mobile Device Connectivity]] for NFC configuration and troubleshooting.

### Functionality

The camera captures video to a file and can be used for real time video streaming for video calls and streaming:

- Usually built-in with a camera and microphone
- Usually includes both audio and video
- It has specialized drivers and software

### Quality Considerations

- **Not good for non-casual use** because of quality
- Can use supplemental external webcams or analog/USB microphones to get better quality

**Upgrade Options:**

- External USB webcams for better video quality
- External USB microphones for better audio quality
- Professional streaming equipment for content creation

> **Troubleshooting Tip:** If built-in camera isn't working, try external USB camera to determine if issue is hardware or software related.
