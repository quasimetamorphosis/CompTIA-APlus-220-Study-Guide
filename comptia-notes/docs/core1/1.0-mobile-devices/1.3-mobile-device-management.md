# Mobile Device Management
If you have an organization and you need to manage the phones of company-owned and user-owned mobile devices you need a **Mobile Device Manager**.
- BYOD - Bring Your Own Device means when users bring their own device to use at work.
When you have BYOD you need a way to centrally mange all of the mobile devices with specialized functionality.

When you have a Mobile Device Manager you can configure or disable policies on apps, data, camera, etc.  Control the mobile device in basically any way. Set up a partition through policy that protects the User's data and makes it distinct what is the user's data and what is the corporation's data.

# BYOD 
**Bring Your Own Device, bring your own technology.** When the employee owns the device the device needs to meet the company's requirements. It is difficult to secure because it is both a home device and a work device. You can configure from the Mobile Device Manager what parts of the device are for home vs what parts are for work purposes. You can set different parameters for how the data is protected. You can also set parameters for what happens when a device is sold or traded in.

# COPE
**Corporate owned, personally enabled** is when the corporation owns the device but the worker uses it. Used as both a corporate device and a personal device.

The organization/corporation keeps full control of the device. It is similar to company-owned laptops and desktops. Information is protected using corporate policies. Information can be deleted at any time.

## CYOD
Means **Choose Your Own Device**similar to COPE, but with User's choice of deviant.

# MDM Policy Enforcement
Having management of all of your mobile devices from a central MDM policy screen provides a lot of flexibility and saves a lot of time. For example you can...
- Configure corporate emails
	- User does not need to configure anything
	- The MDM takes the changes on the device
	- Account details, server addresses, communication methods.
	- They don't need to make any changes to their inbox, everything should work.
- Two-Factor Authentication
	- Require specific authentication types
	- Biometrics, pseudo-random authentication app.
- Corporate applications
	- Allow or restrict app installation
	- Prevent unauthorized app usage
